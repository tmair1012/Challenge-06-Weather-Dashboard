# Challenge-06-Weather-Dashboard
Weather Dashboard for Challenge Six

This project contains the logic necessary to:
1. Select a city in the search bar
2. Return the main weather data for that city including the name and date
3. Return the UV index with Color code to indicate whether good, moderate, or bad
4. Return a five day forecast for that selected area

User will first type in a city into the search bar, and hit submit. The program will then pull the necessary API from three different APIs to return desired information.

The challenges in this application included:
1. Styling the page using grid to make everything append neatly (hardest for sure).
2. Saving to LocalStorage and resulting a previous search button for that city.

Tasks that still need to be completed:
1. Add screenshots to README
2. Properly style webpage to look user-friendly and appealing
3. Create a local storage for past searches.
